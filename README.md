# USPSA
This repo contains a standard USPSA stage template for Microsoft Power Point along with the stages I have designed for different competitions. Feel free to use the resources here. All you need to get started is the template and a bit of MS Power Point knowledge. If you have something to add to the template like a new target or props, please branch and make a pull request with a descent description of what was added so I can find it. I have a `Stages` folder in the repo with `Indoor` and `Outdoor` folders. If you have a really fun stage, go ahead and get them into a branch and send me a merge request. Name them like NameOfTheStage.pptx please.

## Getting started
If you are new to github.com you can download the whole repo using the Code/Download Zip button, unzip it, delete what you don't want and you are good to go. If are proficient with git repos, do your thing. Once you have the repo/files, copy/duplicate the USPSA_StageDesignTemplate.ppt, rename the copy to what you want, and get to work designing your stage. You'll figure out, plenty of MS Power Point tutorials on YouTube.

There is also the USPSA_TheOriginalTemplate.ppt. This the original presentation that contains some designed stages to look how the creator of the presentation used it. Good luck.

## Special thanks!
I did not create the templates. I received this from a shooting friend who I think got it off the web somewhere. Thank you to the person who initial made the templates!
